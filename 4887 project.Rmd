### deal with date string

### deal with null value and delete row with 0 
housing2 <- housing

### change uppercase to lowercase
housing$FlatType <- tolower(housing$FlatType)

### add space between words
housing$FlatType <- gsub("([a-z])(house)", "\\1 \\2", housing$FlatType)
housing$FlatType <- gsub("([a-z])(bungalow)", "\\1 \\2
                         ", housing$FlatType)

### export data to csv

write.csv(housing, "C:\\Users\\siuhi\\OneDrive - Vocational Training Council - Student\\schoolwork\\IT 4887\\group project\\Project_Housing.csv", row.names = FALSE)
